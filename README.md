Simple Android app for calculating the value of a product in one location, based on its price in another.

The interface will be a simple lookup where the user selects a city/country and the app will suggest a currency
(which the user can change). The same is then done for the target location/currency.

The user then inputs how much money they believe a product is worth in their "home" location, and the app will then use
currency exchange rates, and the cost of living index to estimate the price of the same product in the target location.

The hope is that this will allow people who are travelling to not be ripped off due to ignorance of the local market.
